PDF-Tool

A tedious task at my workplace is to merge several project files to one PDF file. Some files have to be converted from MS-Office file types to PDF first. After merging, bookmarks for chapters and page numbers have to be added.

This tool helps to automate single tasks. A GUI is added to improve accessibility and traceability of each function for other employees.
